Megaventory Task Application

1-) In general, while developing the application, I try to follow the SOLID principles and examined the following steps:
First, using the documentation, I reviewed the JSON objects and created custom classes for the JSON objects in the web application. 
Afterwards, I created my Abstart and Concrete folders under the Service folder and aimed to eliminate the dependencies in my project. 
I have included my interfaces in the Abstarct folder and my Classes in the Concrete folder. Then I matched the appropriate services with Dependency Injection. 
I completed my task by calling my services on the Controller side with the Injection process, 
serializing and deserializing the classes I created, and posting the appropriate data to the API section.

2-) In general, I dealt with many API projects, for example, I wrote an API for Angular and called it in my Angular project. 
I also had knowledge about API consuming by writing services in my own project. 
I easily handled the APIKEY side of the task you gave and I can say that it gave me a good experience.
